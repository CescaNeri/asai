## Intelligent Robotics Systems

Requirements for robotics systems:

* Be programmable by **learning** 
* Be able to predict **failure** states in their operating environment and their own bodies 
* **Plan** complex tasks
* Be able to deal with novelty, uncertainty and change (they should be **robust** and **adaptive**)

**Artificial Intelligence** can be a viable approach to robust design for reasoning, planning, learning, problem solving and behavior design.

A robot is an autonomous system which exists in the physical world, can sense its environment ans can act on it to achieve some goals.
Constituents of a robot:

* A physical body
* Sensors
* Effectors and actuators
* A controller

### Self Sufficiency 

Self-sufficiency means an agent's ability to sustain itself over extended periods of time.

* To be self-sufficient, complete agents must be able to perform multiple tasks
* Hence the problem of behavior control

**Autonomy** generally means 'freedom from external control'. Self-sufficiency increases the level of autonomy.
The extent to which an agent can control another depends on the controlling agent's knowledge of the state and internal mechanisms of the agent to be controlled.

*The capacity to learn increases autonomy*

**Adaptivity** is the ability ti adjust oneself to the environment: some property is maintained in changing environmental conditions via the modification of some element.

We can distinguish four types of adaptivity:

1. Evolutionary adaptation
2. Physiological adaptation
3. Sensory adaptation
4. Adaptation by learning

The behavior of an agent is always the result of the interaction with the environment.
