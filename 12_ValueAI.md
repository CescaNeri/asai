To create value with AI, we should not focus on AI.

The market of AI is growing (+32%) from 2021 to 2022, leading to higher investments and bigger opportunities.
The AI market is distributed with the following structure:

* 28% - Language AI
* 19% - Recommendation system
* 10% - COmputer vision
* 9% - Intelligent RPA

Companies have experienced some criticalities and barriers in the adoption of AI:

1. Business case are not replicable (low scalability)
2. Low comprehension of the benefits resulting from the adoption of AI (not easy to translate AI in economical value)
3. To realize AI solutions, a deep understanding of the business processes is needed
4. Estimating the performance of the AI system before implementing it is not easy
