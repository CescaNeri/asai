## AI Ethics

Biases can affect ML models in different ways:

* CV screening
* Healthcare systems 

A bias is an action supporting or opposing a particular person or thing in an unfair way, because of allowing personal opinions to influence your judgement.
Bias are not always unwanted as they are used to perceive possible dangers by almost all animals.

We cannot fix this problem by just removing the features which infer the bias from the database.
The AI model is able to detect such features from the data (sex, race ...).

* Have you checked the labels from the dataset?
* Do you know how the data is labeled?

AI ethics refers to a set of guidelines that advise on the design and outcomes of artificial intelligence.
It regards a set of moral values that AI must comply with.
